# Mobile-Actichture-Inventory-App

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For this app I created a inventory app. The requirments of this app was that the user was able to create, and be able to  login in to their account. AS well as be able to send messaging of reports, or messaging when stock is low. AS well as to add a pin in order to ensure that only the user is trying to send out any information. The next goal was to create a table / database that would hold the information necessary. This would not only allow them to view, but make changes, and new lines in to the inventory, as well as being able to delete. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

While I am still making progress on the app. I have created four screens. The first screen was the login screen. I tried to make this as user friendly and effiecnt as possible. The second screen was a branch off that was a screen for the users to be able to create an account if need be. I made this easy to use and be able to follow how to create an account. The next screen was the table for storing inventory. I added a button for more line to be added. As well as an edit button to make changes as needed or to delete items. The next screen was to send automic messages or reports. I made this a bit frustating but added a pin so if someone else was in there they would not be able to send anything without that pin. This would help to keep these reports secure. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

When coding I started out with the layout. I wanted to be able to see how I wanted it to be able to work. I then worked on making each item that I added functional. This was a process. I also used sprints on myself to be able to get certain screen and components done at certain times. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested it by running the fuction. While not all of them have worked the way that I wanted to it has made it to where I am able to make progress. The first test reveled that I needed to be able to add constrants so that way it would look the way I needed it to. I then tested the functionality. Some od these worked, while others needs some adjusting still. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

In the intial planning I had a lot of different ideas that I could do with the app. One thing that I had to do was shorten up what I wanted to do. This was mainly due to the time constraints and not beeing familar with the program. For the finizalition for the class and the project I had to narrow it down, while most of the app was already functional.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think that the part of the mobile app was the table that was working on a database. This was something that I found to be relevent as I have done alot of work at my time in SNHU on databases. This was showing my skill in other ways.
